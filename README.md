Module 4 - Content Management Systems
Diploma in Web and UX Design (Level 6) | 30 credits | v1.0
You must demonstrate competency in all learning outcomes to successfully complete this assessment.

Overview
You are to produce a CMS website based on the scenarios given, with either your peers, family, friends, or tutor acting as the client. A custom theme will be built with a mix of custom and third-party functionality, and it will be compatible across browsers, devices, and platforms. 

Use cases will be identified for both the end user of the website and the content administrator. Customisation components that allow the administrator to easily configure the website to meet the identified use cases will be planned and built. Prior to production, an industry-standard agreement should be assembled. 

Accompanying the website should be documentation for site administrators. The client will be provided with a training session on how to use the content management system. Best practices for CMS security will be followed and the completed website will be linked to an online portfolio. 

Requirements 
Your website proposal must adhere to Yoobee Best Practices, and in particular, it must include: 
an analysis of cultural or sociological issues that may need to be addressed 
a typography plan 
a plan for the internal team that identifies technical requirements for the custom CMS website/theme and how they will be implemented 
a plan for client customisation functionality 
user testing results 
a customised business agreement 
Compatibility testing results will be recorded and steps will be taken to ensure the site is functional in all major browsers, viewports, and operating systems 
Your completed project will be remotely hosted 
You must train your client to use the completed CMS and record acceptance testing results 
An online portfolio of work will link to the CMS website 
*All work must be morally and ethically acceptable. 

Project scenarios 
In both of the following scenarios, the client wants to be able to easily update content on every page of the site and hopes this can be a simple process. The site should be secure, SEO friendly, and optimised for performance and compatibility. Choose one only. 

Choose one scenario from below: 

Service provider site 
The client is a company owner who offers a variety of service-based products. Until now this company has relied on positive word-of-mouth to engage with new customers, but now the client would like to expand the company and grow their customer base by creating an effective online presence. 

The client wants to allow visitors to be able to access information relating to the services they provide. They also intend to showcase examples of their work, telling stories of particular projects to give potential customers a more intimate view of the business and their relationships with clients. 

Non-profit organisation 
Your client represents a small non-profit organisation that would like to increase awareness of their cause and further it through education and engagement. 

The organisation has two income streams that need to be accommodated on the site. Visitors should be able to donate money, and they also need to be able to purchase products that may include merchandise from a curated online catalogue.

Documentation in pdf format 
The CMS website or custom theme project
